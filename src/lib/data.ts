    excerpt:
      "On 7th October 2024, a team of 16 representatives from Molex Foundation Africa, including two board members and Alhaji Yusif Braimah, visited Royal Seed Home in Kasoa. The home is a charitable institution dedicated to supporting vulnerable children, including orphans and those with physical disabilities.

    content: `<p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">On 7th October 2024, a team of 16 representatives from Molex Foundation Africa, including two board members and Alhaji Yusif Braimah, visited Royal Seed Home in Kasoa. The home is a charitable institution dedicated to supporting vulnerable children, including orphans and those with physical disabilities. The purpose of the visit was to conduct a needs assessment, focusing on how Molex Foundation Africa could support the home by addressing infrastructure, resources, and improving overall conditions for the children.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Upon arrival, the team was warmly welcomed by Nana, the CEO of Royal Seed Home, who shared her inspiring personal story. Nana explained that her own experience of living on the streets motivated her to create a safe haven for vulnerable children. Her reflection on her journey”. While I was living on the street, Royal Seed came to mind", set the tone for a heartfelt and insightful discussion on the challenges and aspirations of the home.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">One of the critical issues discussed during the visit was the water supply. The home relies on borehole water, which is salty and untreated, as well as rainwater for daily needs. Although they have filtration machines to treat the water, frequent power outages make the system unreliable, forcing the home to rely on sachet water for basic needs like cooking and cleaning. The personnel managing the water system explained the difficulties of manually operating the filtration and pumping machines, describing the process as labor-intensive and time-consuming.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">In response to these challenges, Dr. Essien, representing Molex Foundation Africa, assured the home that the foundation would assist in building an automated water pumping system. This system would ensure that water is pumped into storage tanks without manual supervision. Steven, the I.T. Director at Molex, explained that the system would use sensors to monitor water levels and automatically activate the pump, reducing the burden on the staff. He also mentioned the possibility of integrating solar power to address the power shortages.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Education was another major focus of the visit. A teacher from the Royal Seed School proudly shared that ten students had successfully completed their Senior Secondary School education. However, there are concerns about financial difficulties preventing them from pursuing tertiary education. One student passionately expressed her desire to attend university, highlighting the importance of continuing her education. Molex Foundation Africa recognized the need for educational support and pledged to explore partnerships with educational institutions to help these students achieve their dreams.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">The healthcare situation at Royal Seed Home also drew attention. The team toured the clinic, where Miss Eva, an unprofessional nurse, provides basic medical care for the children. She explained that while she had learned some nursing skills from visiting professionals, serious medical cases often had to be referred to a distant public hospital. The foundation acknowledged the need for better healthcare facilities and professional medical support to improve the services provided at the clinic.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Nana also spoke about the unfinished buildings on the premises, which could help alleviate overcrowding and improve living conditions for the children if completed. However, financial constraints have halted construction, and the home is in urgent need of support to complete these projects. Molex Foundation Africa acknowledged this need and will explore ways to help finish the infrastructure.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">To address the water supply issue, the foundation proposed two solutions: the installation of an automated water pumping system powered by renewable energy, such as solar, and the creation of an underground runoff water collection system. This system would capture excess rainwater from rooftops, store it in a backup tank, and ensure efficient distribution, especially for drinking water.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">To address the water supply issue, the foundation proposed two solutions: the installation of an automated water pumping system powered by renewable energy, such as solar, and the creation of an underground runoff water collection system.

Nana and her team have done remarkable work in caring for vulnerable children despite the many challenges they face. We at Molex Foundation Africa are committed to doing all we can, but we cannot do it alone. We urge businesses, foundations, and individuals with the means to contribute toward making a lasting impact on the lives of these children. Your support, whether through financial contributions, resources, or partnerships, can help transform the lives of the children at Royal Seed Home and give them the opportunity for a brighter future. Together, we can make a meaningful difference. Let us join hands to uplift Royal Seed Home and provide these children with the safe, nurturing environment they need to thrive.</span></p><p><br></p>`,

    content: `<p class="ql-align-justify">Education is the foundation for the development and transformation of any nation. Countries that have reset their economies and transitioned from struggling systems to productive societies have done so through robust and practical education systems. Ghana finds itself at a crossroads, with the current government promising to reset the nation from its economic struggles, increase productivity, and make unemployment a thing of the past. However, achieving this vision requires a fundamental shift in how we approach education—specifically, a stronger focus on Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET).</p><p>One of Ghana’s longstanding challenges has been the disconnect between education and industry needs. Our system has largely focused on theoretical knowledge, leaving many graduates without the practical skills needed for the job market. To truly reset Ghana, we must make education more practical, skill-based, and aligned with industry demands. A practical education system will not only create employment opportunities but also empower Ghanaians to become job creators rather than job seekers.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/12HEeYfXryT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>Dr. Patrick Essien</u></strong></a>, a lecturer at the University of Cape Coast and a renowned STEM/TVET expert, has advised the government to prioritize the establishment of free TVET centers across the country to produce more skilled graduates. He argues that Competency-Based Training (CBT) under TVET can serve as a game-changer if given the necessary attention.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Ghana has witnessed significant investments in secondary education infrastructure. The previous National Democratic Congress (NDC) administration, under the leadership of John Dramani Mahama, made the single largest contribution to secondary school stock by constructing 124 Community Day Senior High Schools, 46 of which were operationalized, and 27 others completed, as stated in Page 16 of the NDC 2024 Manifesto. While this effort was commendable, the next logical step should be a strategic shift towards Community-Based TVET Centers.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/12HEeYfXryT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>Dr. Essien</u></strong></a> advocates that TVET centers should be designed based on the major production of raw materials in each community. This approach will ensure that education is directly linked to local economies, creating sustainable employment opportunities.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Here are some examples of how Community-Based TVET Centers can be implemented:</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><br></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Agricultural Processing and Value Addition</strong></p><ul><li>Communities in the Ashanti Region (Ejura, Mampong) and Brong-Ahafo Region (Techiman, Kintampo), known for their maize and yam production, should have TVET programs focusing on food processing, storage, and agribusiness development.</li><li class="ql-align-justify">Cocoa-producing areas like Sefwi, Suhum, and Nkawkaw should have TVET courses in cocoa processing, chocolate-making, and agro-processing industries.</li></ul><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Sustainable Mining and Mineral Processing</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Mining communities like Tarkwa, Obuasi, and Prestea should offer TVET programs in safe and sustainable mining, mineral refining, and jewelry production, ensuring that raw materials are processed locally instead of being exported in raw form.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Water Engineering and Environmental Management</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Communities around major rivers such as the Volta Region, Central Gonja (Bui Dam), and Northern Region should have TVET courses in water engineering, irrigation systems, dam construction, and environmental conservation. This will promote responsible water use and preservation for future generations.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>Forestry, Herbal Medicine, and Wood Technology</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">Forest zone communities like Goaso, Nkawie, and Samreboi should focus on forestry management, timber processing, furniture production, and herbal medicine development. This will support sustainable forestry and alternative medicinal industries.</p><p><strong>A Path to Economic Transformation</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">By adopting this community-based TVET strategy, Ghana can reset its economic trajectory and reduce unemployment. Such initiatives will ensure that education is not just a pathway to certification but a direct bridge to productivity and self-reliance. Competency-Based Training (CBT) is key—our graduates must be equipped with hands-on skills that align with industry needs, thereby reducing dependency on government jobs and fostering entrepreneurship.</p><p><strong>Call to Action for the President</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">As Ghana’s current leadership seeks to reset the nation, H. E. President John Dramani Mahama and his administration must prioritize practical education reforms. Free TVET Centers aligned with community industries will be a major step toward economic recovery and sustainable development.</p><p>The time for action is now. Ghana’s future depends on an education system that truly empowers its people with the skills needed to transform industries, create jobs, and drive economic growth. By embracing TVET as the cornerstone of education reform, the government will not only fulfill its promise to reset Ghana but also secure a prosperous future for generations to come.</p><p><br></p>`,

    excerpt:
      "On June 12, 2025, MOLEX Foundation, in collaboration with the Department of Children under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, commemorated the World Day Against Child Labour with a community sensitization exercise in Moree, a fishing community in Ghana’s Central Region. This year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: Let’s speed up efforts,” reflected the urgency to intensify collective actions in the fight against child labour.",
    content: `<p>On June 12, 2025, MOLEX Foundation, in collaboration with the Department of Children under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, commemorated the World Day Against Child Labour with a community sensitization exercise in Moree, a fishing community in Ghana’s Central Region. This year’s theme, “Progress is clear, but there’s more to do: Let’s speed up efforts,” reflected the urgency to intensify collective actions in the fight against child labour.</p><p>The event brought together children and parents from the community for an open and interactive dialogue. Many of the children had never heard the term “child labour” before. Using illustrated placards and relatable examples, facilitators explained the concept and helped the children identify real-life instances of child labour in their surroundings. Some pointed to peers who carry wood for fishermen, while others shared their own experiences of dropping out of school or never enrolling in the first place.</p><p>The reasons behind their disengagement from education varied. Some children cited financial hardship and the inability to afford uniforms or learning materials. Others expressed disinterest in formal schooling, preferring to engage in economic activities such as fishing or learning a trade. A few mentioned negative experiences at school, including bullying from teachers or classmates, which discouraged them from returning. Alarmingly, many of the children admitted they had no clear aspirations for their future.</p><p>Facilitators also engaged with parents, who echoed similar concerns. They spoke of inadequate school infrastructure that forces a shift system and limits learning hours. Financial constraints were a recurring theme, and some parents expressed frustration that their children preferred chasing quick income or engaging in game betting rather than attending school or learning a trade. One mother shared her distress over a child who had refused both schooling and apprenticeship, instead following fishermen and gambling.</p><p>In addressing these issues, the team emphasized education as a vital investment in the future, not just for the individual child but for the community at large. They encouraged children to view education as a pathway to opportunity and parents to remain committed to their children’s learning, even amid economic hardship. To inspire hope, the team shared the story of the late Dr. Paa Kwesi Amissah-Arthur, a native of Moree who rose to become Vice President of Ghana. His life stood as a testimony to what is possible through perseverance, education, and community support.</p><p>The session also highlighted the negative health effects of child labour. Facilitators explained how hazardous work can cause long-term damage, including stunted growth, fatigue, and chronic injuries. Children were advised to avoid harmful activities such as game betting and were encouraged to pursue skills training if formal education did not appeal to them. </p><p>The exercise revealed widespread challenges, including low awareness of child labour, high dropout rates, poor infrastructure, and economic pressure that forces children into work. Yet, it also demonstrated the community’s willingness to reflect and engage in dialogue. While not every child or parent was immediately receptive, many left with new perspectives and a deeper understanding of the long-term value of education and child protection.</p><p>This year’s World Day Against Child Labour in Moree served as a reminder of the importance of grassroots engagement in ending child labour. Through continued collaboration, education, and empowerment, MOLEX Foundation believes that communities like Moree can build a future where every child is protected, educated, and given the opportunity to succeed.</p><p><br></p>`,

    excerpt:
      "MOLEX Foundation Africa, in collaboration with the Ghana Education Service in the Abura Asebu Kwamankese (AAK) District, successfully organized a vibrant STEM exhibition that brought together over 30 basic schools to showcase innovation, creativity, and problem-solving skills among young learners.",
    content: `<p>MOLEX Foundation Africa, in collaboration with the Ghana Education Service in the Abura Asebu Kwamankese (AAK) District, successfully organized a vibrant STEM exhibition that brought together over 30 basic schools to showcase innovation, creativity, and problem-solving skills among young learners.</p><p>Held in the Central Region, the event aimed to inspire students to apply science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to address real-life challenges within their communities. Participating schools included Baiden Walker Basic School, Abura Dunkwa Methodist and Catholic A & B Basic Schools, Nyanfeku Ekroful Methodist and Catholic Schools, Moree D/A Basic School, and many others.</p><p>The exhibition was well attended by the Regional and District STEM Coordinators, representatives from the Ghana Education Service, executives of MOLEX Foundation Africa, and other distinguished guests who came to witness the ingenuity of the young participants.</p><p>The program began with an impressive presentation from Asuansi D/A Basic School. Their team of young innovators displayed a smart standing fan integrated with a Bluetooth speaker. Constructed using wood, cardboard, a motor, and fan blades, the project was not only functional but also cost-effective, designed for everyday household use.</p><p>New Ebu St. Simons Catholic School followed with a dual presentation. The first was a smart dustbin made from cardboard and fitted with an ultrasonic sensor that allows it to open automatically when someone approaches, promoting hygiene and minimizing the need for contact. Their second project was a smart house model featuring lighting control using LEDs and an external ultrasonic sensor that detects movement. The students explained that this could alert homeowners of nearby activity and help reduce the risk of theft and robbery in their communities.</p><p>Another remarkable innovation came from Bosomin D/A Basic School. Their team presented a smart irrigation system that uses soil moisture sensors to determine when the soil is dry and activates a water pump to irrigate the crops. This solution is especially beneficial for farmers in rural areas, where rainfall is often inconsistent. By automating the irrigation process, the system helps conserve water, improve crop yields, and support sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Several other schools impressed the audience with a range of creative and practical innovations. These included robotic cars that require no fuel, solar-powered panels, rechargeable study lamps, drones made from cardboard, water purification systems, and more. Each project reflected a thoughtful response to real-world issues and showed the students’ deep engagement with STEM learning.</p><p>MOLEX Foundation Africa served as judges for the exhibition, drawing on our expertise in training girls, children, and teachers in STEM. We assessed the projects based on their relevance to real-world problems, functionality, and the confidence and clarity with which students presented their ideas.</p><p>This exhibition reaffirmed our belief that empowering young minds through STEM education is key to Ghana’s future. The energy, passion, and potential on display were inspiring. MOLEX Foundation Africa remains committed to providing opportunities that nurture innovation and create meaningful impact in our communities.</p><p>We extend our appreciation to the Ghana Education Service in AAK District for their leadership and look forward to continued collaboration in driving STEM education across the country.</p><p><br></p>`,

    Captain Tabitha Simons-Dadzie's life journey is a testament to perseverance and dedication to healthcare. Born in Nyanfeku Ekroful, Ghana, she began her education locally before pursuing nursing at Cape Coast Nursing and Midwifery Training School, driven by her passion for quality healthcare.

Tabitha's career flourished as she contributed significantly to healthcare institutions, including Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Cape Coast Metropolitan Hospital, Adisadel, and Ewim Polyclinic, earning respect for her unwavering dedication and professionalism.

She further specialized in Ears, Nose, and Throat (E.N.T) medicine at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, enhancing her ability to provide specialized care. Her journey then took her to the Ghana Armed Forces, where she excelled as an E.N.T Specialist, achieving the rank of Captain and serving at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra.

Beyond her medical career, Tabitha chairs the Molex Foundation Africa, advocating for the girl- child in STEM fields and gender equality. My commitment to the well-being of others, especially the girl-child has propelled me to give back to society. I am passionate about helping the girl- child to bridge gender disparity and ensuring that the girl-child is mentored and coached to be able to learn, decide, and thrive in STEM fields.
